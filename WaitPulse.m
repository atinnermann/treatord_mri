 function [secs,t]=WaitPulse(t,keycode,n)
        %[secs]=WaitPulse(keycode,n)
        %
        %   This function waits for the Nth upcoming pulse. If N=1, it will wait for
        %   the very next pulse to arrive. 1 MEANS NEXT PULSE. So if you wish to wait
        %   for 6 full dummy scans, you should use N = 7 to be sure that at least 6
        %   full acquisitions are finished.
        %
        %   The function avoids KbCheck, KbWait functions, but relies on the OS
        %   level event queues, which are much less likely to skip short events. A
        %   nice discussion on the topic can be found here:
